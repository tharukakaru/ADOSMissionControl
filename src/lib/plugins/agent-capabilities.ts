/**
 * Mirror of the ARCOSDroneAgent agent capability catalog.
 *
 * TypeScript copy of the agent-side capability catalog. The agent is the
 * source of truth; this mirror exists so the GCS can render label +
 * description + risk metadata for agent-side capability ids when the install
 * dialog parses a `.arcosplug` manifest locally (the cloud-relay path does not
 * consult the agent before showing the pre-install review).
 *
 * The catalog data is generated from `capabilities.toml` by
 * `arcos-capabilities-codegen`, which emits the same catalog for Python, Rust,
 * and TypeScript so the three cannot drift. The generated data lives in
 * `./agent-capabilities.generated`; this module re-exports it and adds the
 * helpers. Edit the TOML and regenerate, never the generated file.
 *
 * Drift detection also runs through `tests/unit/capability-catalog-parity.test.ts`.
