/**
 * Canonical capability catalog for ARCOS plugin GCS halves.
 *
 * Authoritative list of named capabilities the GCS half of a plugin
 * manifest may declare. The install dialog surfaces these in the
 * permission summary and risk badge. Today only `ui.slot.*`
 * registration is enforced by the slot whitelist; the rest are
 * recorded in the install record and shown to the operator at install
 * time, with runtime gates landing per surface as it ships.
 *
 * The id list (`GCS_CAPABILITIES`) and the metadata (`CAPABILITY_CATALOG`)
 * are generated from `capabilities.toml` by `arcos-capabilities-codegen`,
 * which emits the same catalog for Python, Rust, and TypeScript so the three
 * cannot drift. The generated data lives in `./gcs-capabilities.generated`;
 * this module re-exports it and adds the types, the consistency check, and the
 * helpers. Edit the TOML and regenerate, never the generated file.
 *
 * Agent-side capability ids come back from the agent `/api/plugins/parse` and
 * `/api/plugins/install` endpoints with the same metadata fields already
 * inlined; the GCS also keeps a mirror at `./agent-capabilities.ts` for the
 * cloud-relay preview path where the dialog parses the manifest before the
 * agent ever sees the archive. `getMergedCapabilityMeta()` consults the agent
 * mirror first and falls back to the GCS-side catalog, then to an "unknown"
 * placeholder for ids neither catalog declares.
