/**
 * @module VisionDetectionsStore
 * @description Per-drone store of the latest vision detection batch the
 * GCS knows about. The video overlay reads the active drone's batch and
 * draws bounding boxes scaled to the video element.
 *
 * A detection batch carries pixel-space boxes in the frame's own
 * resolution (origin top-left). Each batch declares its source frame
 * width/height so the overlay can map frame pixels onto the rendered
 * video rectangle regardless of the element's display size.
 *
 * TRANSPORT (live detections):
 *   The agent publishes detections on the `vision.detection` topic, and
 *   the engine re-broadcasts every per-frame `DetectionBatch` (model_id,
 *   camera_id, frame_id, ts_ms, detections[]) onto a Unix socket the
 *   agent's API process forwards to the browser over a WebSocket. The LAN
 *   client at `@/lib/agent/vision-detections-ws` opens that WebSocket for a
 *   paired drone, maps each batch onto the shape below, and calls
 *   `setBatch()`. A demo/test injector can also call `setBatch()` directly.
 *   The cloud-relay path for a remote drone (a vision/detection MQTT topic
 *   via `arcos-cloud`) is a documented follow-up; it feeds the same
 *   `setBatch()`, so adding it stays purely additive.
