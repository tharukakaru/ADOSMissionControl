// Embedded baseline catalog for the Flash Tool.
//
// Used when no GitHub release manifest is reachable. Curl one-liners point
// at the canonical install script uploaded to the latest GitHub Release
// (releases/latest/download/install.sh) so install bodies match what was
// tested at release time, not whatever happens to be on main when the
// operator runs the command. Every board installs the single agent via the
// same install.sh; the profile flag selects drone vs ground-station.
//
// Lives in a sibling module to route.ts because Next.js Route segment
// files may only export the HTTP method handlers and route-segment
// options. Keeping the catalog in a private sibling lets route.ts serve it
// without violating that constraint.
