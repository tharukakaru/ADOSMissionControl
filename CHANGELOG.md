# Changelog

All notable changes to ARCOS Mission Control are recorded here.
Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/);
the project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [0.29.8] - 2026-06-04

### Fixed

- The cloud relay now forwards every radio field generically (snake_case to
  camelCase) and records the radio transmit-rate and churn counters (transmit
  zombie kills, transmit bytes per second, restart count). A thrashing or
  zombie transmitter is now visible remotely on a self-hosted backend, matching
  the hosted backend.

## [0.29.2] - 2026-06-01

### Added

- **Radio USB-degradation warning.** The radio panel now warns when the agent
  reports its WFB adapter enumerated on a slow (full-speed, 12 Mbps) USB link —
  a state where the radio advances its transmit counter yet emits no usable RF.
  It shows the speed and flows through both the local link and the cloud relay.

## [0.29.1] - 2026-06-01

### Added

- **Radio stack state on the link health card.** The radio panel now shows the
  agent's coarse radio-stack rollup ("OK", or the reason it is not transmitting:
  no injection-capable adapter, unpaired, missing bind keys, or an incomplete
  radio stack), highlighted when it is not OK. The field was already carried
  over the cloud relay; this surfaces it.

## [0.28.0] - 2026-05-29

### Removed

- **ROS tab and capability surface.** The Command-page ROS sub-tab, its store,
  API client, and types are gone, along with the `ros2State` capability and the
  `foxgloveBindFailed` heartbeat field (schema, mutation args, status mapper,
  and cloud bridge). The agent no longer ships a ROS environment, so the GCS no
  longer surfaces one.

## [0.26.0] - 2026-05-27

### Added

- **Radio link state on the Hardware tab.** The radio panel now shows the
  home (rendezvous) channel, the current channel and band, whether the drone
  is actually transmitting, the peer-link state (linked / searching / no
  peer), the hop state, and the regulatory domain when set. A silently stuck
  link is now visible instead of looking idle. Read-only; the home channel is
  a fixed rendezvous value both sides boot on.

## [0.25.3] - 2026-05-27

### Fixed

- **No console error when a pairing code is not found.** Resolving a code that
  the cloud relay does not know (the agent is in local mode, the default) no
  longer logs anything to the browser console. The claim function now returns
  an expected "not found" result instead of throwing, so the Convex client has
  no server error to report. The calm local-first message and the "Pair on
  this network" button are unchanged; they now key off the returned result.

## [0.25.2] - 2026-05-27

### Fixed

- **Clearer failure when a pairing code is not found.** Entering a code for an
  agent that is reachable on your network but not registered with the cloud
  relay used to tell you to check the agent's internet connection. The dialog
  now shows a calm message with a "Pair on this network" button that jumps
  straight to pairing by hostname or IP, which is the path that works on a
  single network. The Add-a-Node form also nudges you to enter the hostname
  when a code does not resolve.

## [0.24.0] - 2026-05-25

### Added

- **Video transmitter stall indicator on the radio panel.** When an agent
  reports that its video transmitter has wedged and is being recovered,
  the radio link card shows a "Video TX stalled" warning and the number of
  recoveries so far. The cloud-relay heartbeat, the stored drone status,
  and the per-drone radio state now carry the video-tx liveness fields end
  to end, so a silently stalled video link is visible remotely instead of
  only on the rig.

## [0.19.5] - 2026-05-16

### Added

- **Per-drone plugin install model.** Plugins are now installed against a
  specific drone rather than the whole fleet. The drone detail panel
  carries a Plugins tab that lists only the plugins installed on that
  drone, with install, enable, disable, configure, and uninstall actions
  scoped to that drone. The fleet view at Settings -> Plugins still lists
  every install across all drones grouped by plugin id; the "Apply to all
  drones" button on each row is reserved for a follow-up release and
  ships disabled. The install dialog runs the same six-stage flow
  (queued, commanded, downloading, verifying, installing, completed)
  whether the agent is reachable on the LAN or only through the cloud
  relay; the dialog picks the transport based on the page protocol and
  the agent's pairing mode.
- **`drone.detail.tab` UI slot.** A new slot lets a plugin contribute a
  per-drone tab to the drone detail panel. The slot is keyed by the
  active drone id; switching drones unmounts the previous drone's
  plugin iframes after a 300 ms pause-resume grace and lazily mounts
  the new drone's plugin tabs on first focus. An LRU cap of 8 mounted
  iframes per drone-detail panel keeps memory bounded; the ninth tab
  opens by evicting the least-recently-focused.
- **Vision navigation telemetry channel.** Drones running the
  `com.altnautica.vision-nav` plugin now surface a Navigation tab on
  the drone detail panel. The tab renders the live optical flow rate
  in rad/s, the flow quality (0-255), the rangefinder reading and
  health, the active EKF source set (ArduPilot), and a four-card arm
  readiness summary (camera healthy, rangefinder healthy, EKF position
  healthy, FC armable). Telemetry feeds through a ring-buffered store
  with capacity 1000 samples per channel.
- **EKF source-set encoder.** `MAV_CMD_SET_EKF_SOURCE_SET` (command id
  42007) ships as a typed encoder under `src/lib/protocol/encoders/`.
  ArduPilot accepts the command at runtime to swap between SRC1, SRC2,
  and SRC3. PX4 has no runtime equivalent; the Navigation tab disables
  the switcher on PX4 firmware and points the operator at the
  parameter-write path instead.
- **Three new MAVLink decoders.** `OPTICAL_FLOW_RAD` (msg id 106),
  `VISION_POSITION_ESTIMATE` (msg id 102), `ODOMETRY` (msg id 331).
  Each decoder lands under `src/lib/protocol/messages/` with its
  CRC_EXTRA wired into the parser table and a typed callback on the
  `DroneProtocol` interface. The mock protocol gets matching stubs so
  every consumer works in demo mode.
- **`NavigationCapability` flag.** Added to the per-drone capability
  store at `src/stores/agent-capabilities-store.ts`. The capability is
  reported by the agent's heartbeat when the vision-nav plugin is
  installed and enabled. The drone-card pill at
  `src/components/shared/drone-card.tsx` renders a small `Nav` chip
  when the capability is present so the fleet view shows at a glance
  which drones have vision navigation active.
- **Pre-arm vision channel.** A new pre-arm helper batches the FC
  parameter writes the vision-nav plugin needs (FLOW_TYPE,
  EK3_SRC1_*, EK3_FLOW_DELAY, EK3_FLOW_QUAL_MIN, RNGFND1_*) and
  verifies each one read back correctly before reporting success.
  PX4 has a matching helper for the EKF2_OF_* parameter set.
- **Capability-token bridge gains per-drone scope.** Tokens minted by
  `cmdPluginCapabilityTokens.mintToken({pluginInstallId, deviceId})`
  carry the agent id as a claim. The bridge at
  `src/lib/plugins/bridge.ts` validates that the token's agent id
  matches the currently-selected drone on every plugin RPC; cross-drone
  RPCs are rejected before they reach the agent.
- **i18n keys for the Navigation tab and the per-drone Plugins tab.**
  16 non-English locales receive parity entries. Real translations are
  a follow-up for the community translation pipeline.

### Changed

- The Plugins surface is split into two views. Settings -> Plugins is
  the fleet view; the drone detail panel's Plugins tab is the
  per-drone view. Both read from `cmd_pluginInstalls` with different
  filters.
- `cmd_pluginInstalls` Convex table amends `droneId` from optional to
  required. A new compound index `by_user_drone_plugin` powers the
  per-drone list. No production migration is needed because no
  production installs predate this release.

## [0.17.1] - 2026-05-14

### Changed

- Command sidebar UX cleanup. The "Pair New Node" button moved from
  the footer to a top strip so it's the first row below the header.
  The redundant horizontal divider that used to render above the
  Nodes group when no cloud-paired drones existed is gone — the
  divider now only appears when there's content above it to separate
  from. The collapsed (narrow) sidebar now renders LAN-paired nodes
  alongside cloud-paired ones; previously the rail hid every local
  agent until the operator expanded the sidebar. Each LAN-paired
  icon in the collapsed rail carries a small accent dot top-left so
  it reads distinctly from cloud-paired entries at a glance.
- Collapsed-rail clicks now share the same LAN-vs-cloud branching as
  the expanded list. A new `src/lib/agent/node-click-handler.ts`
  exports a single `selectNode` helper that both surfaces call;
  HTTPS origins still route LAN-paired nodes through the cloud relay
  (mixed-content guard), HTTP origins prefer the direct REST path.

## [0.17.0] - 2026-05-14

### Added

- LAN-first code pair. Entering a 6-character pair code now scans the
  local network over mDNS (`_arcos._tcp.local.`), probes each candidate
  for its current pair code, and claims the match directly. No cloud
  relay round-trip needed when the agent is on the same LAN, so code
  pair works against a fresh-installed agent even when its outbound
  cloud beacon is disabled. The Convex `claimPairingCodeAnon` path
  remains as a cross-network fallback for cases where the agent has
  beaconing enabled and the GCS is off-LAN.
- New `/api/lan-pair/discover` route, Node-side mDNS browser via
  `bonjour-service`. Returns the LAN-visible ARCOS agents with mDNS
  host, IPv4, and port within a 3-second discovery window. Same
  private-host whitelist as the existing probe route.

### Changed

- All pair-flow calls (`probe`, `claim`, `unpair`) now go through the
  Mission Control proxy regardless of origin. The browser-side direct
  fetch path is gone — browsers without mDNS resolution (Safari with
  some link-local DNS configs, Brave's strict privacy mode, Firefox
  without permission) used to hit "Failed to fetch" when the user
  pasted a `*.local` hostname. The Node-side resolver speaks mDNS, so
  the proxy hop fixes the gap. Pair is a one-off operation, so the
  extra round-trip is invisible to perceived latency.
- Better error when the LAN scan finds nothing AND the Convex
  fallback rejects the code: the new `codeNoLanMatchError` message
  names the two conditions to check (same Wi-Fi, beacon enabled on
  the agent) instead of the generic "Invalid pairing code".

## [0.16.1] - 2026-05-14

### Fixed

- Clicking a node on an HTTPS origin no longer hangs indefinitely on
  "Waiting for agent connection..." when the cloud relay path can't reach
  the agent (agent not cloud-paired, or user not signed in). After 15
  seconds without a heartbeat, the spinner is replaced with an actionable
  error card explaining the two options: open Mission Control from the
  LAN URL for direct mode, or sign in and pair the agent with a
  6-character code to enable cloud relay.

## [0.16.0] - 2026-05-14

### Fixed

- Clicking a locally-paired node in the Command sidebar from an HTTPS
  origin now routes through the cloud relay instead of failing silently.
  The prior direct REST path tripped browser mixed-content protection
  (`https://` page → `http://<host>:8080` fetch), the fetch was rejected,
  and the error was swallowed by the click handler's try/catch. The
  Overview tab was the visible casualty — it never rendered because the
  agent status never populated. The handler now detects an HTTPS origin
  and subscribes to the agent heartbeat through Convex `cmd_droneStatus`
  by `deviceId`, which is populated by the agent regardless of pair
  flavor. HTTP origins (desktop, localhost) still use the faster direct
  REST path.
- Connection errors raised inside the sidebar click handler now surface
  in the connection bar instead of being swallowed by the catch block.

### Changed

- Command sidebar terminology renamed from "drone" to "node". An ARCOS
  agent can run as a drone agent, ground agent, compute agent, relay
  agent, or receiver agent — the umbrella term in the UI is now "node".
  Each row shows the specific agent type as a subtitle, derived from
  the heartbeat profile (`Drone Agent · Raspberry Pi 4B`,
  `Ground Agent · ROCK 5C Lite`, etc.). The renamed copy lands in all
  16 locale files; non-English locales carry the English string until
  a translation pass runs.
- The NodeSidebar section below the cloud-paired list collapses its
  five per-profile groups into a single flat "Nodes" list. With per-row
  agent-type labels, the extra group headers were redundant for the
  typical two-to-five node case.
- The empty "No nodes paired" CTA above the NodeSidebar now hides when
  the NodeSidebar has any local-paired nodes to render. The prior
  layout showed a misleading "Pair Your First Node" prompt above a
  populated list when the user wasn't signed in.

## [0.10.6] - 2026-05-07

### Added

- Fleet drone card now surfaces a small amber "auto" pill when the agent
  reports that its profile was picked by hardware auto-detection rather
  than an operator. Three values trigger the pill: `detected` (clean
  fingerprint match), `tiebreaker` (auto with ambiguous signals), and
  `default` (no detect signals, fell back). Profiles set by an operator
  in the setup webapp or forced via `/etc/arcos/board_override` render
  no pill, matching the prior layout for legacy heartbeats.
- Cloud heartbeat schema accepts two new optional fields, `setupState`
  and `profileSource`, so the universal setup contract on the agent
  side has a place to land in the cloud relay. Both flow into the
  per-drone capability store. `profileSource` also syncs into the
  `cmd_drones` row alongside `runtimeMode` and `attachedDisplayType`
  so the fleet card renders the pill without an extra per-drone query.

## [0.10.5] - 2026-05-06

### Fixed

- Desktop release pipeline now builds the macOS DMG. The `@xmldom/xmldom`
  override pinned the package to `^0.9.10`, whose strict-mode parser
  rejects `parseFromString(content)` calls without a mime type. That
  broke `electron-builder`'s plist parser end of `app-builder-lib`,
  which relies on the older lenient API. Override relaxed to `^0.8.10`
  so the security-patched `0.8.x` line ships and the build pipeline
  succeeds. No source code imports `@xmldom/xmldom` directly; this
  override only affected transitive consumers.

## [0.10.4] - 2026-05-06

Headline fix: the desktop app no longer hangs as a hidden process when the
embedded server fails to start. Plus a wide pass on the firmware tab, plugin
host foundation, fleet overview, and the Hardware tab.

### Fixed

- Desktop app now opens its window reliably on macOS and Windows. Previously,
  if the embedded Next.js standalone server failed to start within the
  startup timeout, the window-creation path was never reached and the app
  sat as a hidden process with no way to recover. Three changes close this:
  - `app.whenReady()` is wrapped so any startup failure surfaces an error
    dialog and the app exits cleanly instead of leaving a windowless process.
  - The window force-shows on `did-finish-load` and `did-fail-load` so a
    renderer that loads but never emits `ready-to-show`, or a page that
    fails to load, no longer leaves the user staring at a dock icon.
  - Server-startup wait reduced from 30s to 15s so genuine failures surface
    quickly instead of feeling like the app is frozen.
- Single-instance lock now hard-exits the secondary process instead of
  letting initialization continue past `app.quit()`.
- Windows installer events (`--squirrel-install`, `--squirrel-updated`,
  `--squirrel-uninstall`, `--squirrel-obsolete`) exit the app immediately
  so installer-spawned processes do not linger as windowless background apps.

### Added

- **ARCOS agent stack support in the firmware tab.** Flash the agent
  software stack alongside flight-controller firmware, with a Rockchip
  bootrom flasher for ARCOS-class companion computers. The agent manifest
  is signed with minisign and verified at install time; an offline catalog
  UI lets operators pick a build without a live network connection. Schema
  versioning on the manifest keeps older clients compatible.
- **Fleet overview** with live video and telemetry on the Command page.
  Multiple drones at a glance, with each card pulling its own status,
  battery, GPS fix, runtime mode, and live preview.
- **Plugin host foundation** for ARCOS plugins. Settings page exposes a
  Plugins tab with an installed-plugins list and a registry browser. The
  slot orchestrator mounts each plugin contribution into a sandboxed
  iframe gated on a `ui.slot.*` capability. Two-stage install dialog
  parses the manifest and shows the permission set before commit, with
  partial-grant failure surfaces and pinned required permissions.
- **Hardware tab** surfaces attached SPI displays at the fleet level and
  on individual drone cards. The tab populates from the agent's
  `profile` and `hardware-check` payloads, and `runtimeMode` propagates
  through the capability inference fallback path so older agents without
  an explicit field still gate features correctly.
- **Setup-and-access integration** end-to-end with the agent. The Command
  page consumes the universal setup contract (status, access URLs,
  remote-access state) and surfaces it with cloud-relay enhancements.
- **CLI service-management and production-deployment wizard** for
  self-hosted Convex backends.
- `/pair` deep link now accepts a pre-filled pairing code, simplifying
  field setup from a printed sticker or QR.
- Camera-trigger toggle on simulation drones, with sync-performance
  improvements while the toggle runs.
- Conditional planner UI render based on whether a plan is active, idle,
  loaded, or dirty.

### Changed

- **Capability inference** now covers BCM2710A1 (Pi Zero 2 W), BCM2711
  (Pi 4B), BCM2712 (Pi 5), RV1106G3 (Luckfox class), and RV1103 SoCs,
  with NPU TOPS lookup for each.
- **Runtime-mode propagation:** `runtimeMode` flows from the agent
  heartbeat through `cmd_droneStatus` and `cmd_drones` into the
  capability store. The fleet card renders a small "Lite" pill for
  drones running the constrained backend; Smart Modes, ROS, and Scripts
  tabs hide on lite-mode drones.
- **Cloud-relay HTTP routes** moved behind internal Convex functions,
  with input validation, response size limits, and safety overrides on
  every command-path entry.
- **Cloud-command gating:** the GCS no longer enqueues cloud commands
  when the user is not authenticated.
- **Convex skip-guards** added across the Command page so reactive
  queries no longer crash when auth or runtime context is absent.
- **Locale-aware number rendering** for currency, percent, and decimal
  values; telemetry freshness now flags stale data older than 45s.
- **Zustand store hardening:** added version + migrate handlers across
  persisted stores; previously `any`-typed surfaces now use Zod schemas
  for runtime validation.
- iNav mock protocol corrections and roadmap-copy refresh in locales.

## [0.10.1] - 2026-05-05

Companion release for the lightweight Rust agent backend. Surfaces a
"Lite" pill on the fleet card and hides UI surfaces the lite backend
does not ship.

### Added
- Fleet card renders a small "Lite" badge next to the drone name when
  the agent reports `runtimeMode: "lite"`. Visible at a glance so
  operators know the drone is running the constrained backend.
- `runtimeMode` field on the `cmd_droneStatus` table and on the
  `cmd_drones` table. The status push handler propagates the value
  from heartbeats into the paired-drone row so reactive consumers
  pick it up without a second query. Schema additions are
  optional / backward-compatible; existing clients see `undefined`
  and default to "full".
- `runtimeMode` field on the `AgentCapabilities` interface and the
  `agent-capabilities-store`. The capability normalizer accepts
  either `runtimeMode` or `runtime_mode` from agent payloads.
- SoC-to-NPU table entries for BCM2710A1 (Pi Zero 2 W), BCM2711
  (Pi 4B / CM4), BCM2712 (Pi 5), RV1106G3 (Luckfox Pico Zero),
  and RV1103 (Luckfox Pico) so capability inference does not return
  null for those targets.

### Changed
- `useVisibleTabs` excludes the Smart Modes, ROS, and Scripts
  Command-page sub-tabs when `runtimeMode === "lite"`. The lite
  backend does not ship the plugin host, peripheral manager,
  scripting tier, or ROS integration; offering those tabs would lead
  to broken handlers.
- `FleetDrone` and `CloudDroneBridge` carry the `runtimeMode`
  field through to the fleet store so the drone card can read it
  without subscribing to a per-drone status query.
- The Calibrate, Parameters, and Configure tabs on the drone-detail
  panel are intentionally NOT gated. They serve all backend variants
  including lite (FC connection works on lite) and stay visible.

### Notes
- The lite Rust agent codebase lives at `agents/lite-rs/` in the
  ARCOSDroneAgent repository. CI publishes prebuilt signed binaries
  to GitHub Releases. Operators install the lite backend with
  `ARCOS_PROFILE=lite-rs` set as an environment variable on the
  install.sh invocation.

## [0.9.11] - 2026-05-04

This release lands universal-setup integration on the GCS side and
a security + reliability sweep on the cloud-relay surface.

### Added

- **Setup-and-access card.** New shared component at
  `src/components/hardware/SetupAccessCard.tsx`. Reads the agent's
  `/api/v1/setup/status` (or, when no agent is connected locally,
  the most recent cloud-relay snapshot) and shows completion
  percent, the next-action sentence, MAVLink / video / remote-access
  state, and direct links to the agent's setup webapp and any
  advertised tunnel URL.
- **Disconnected-state setup handoff.** The Hardware Overview empty
  state now surfaces "Open setup" when the cloud relay carries an
  advertised setup URL for any drone the operator has paired,
  alongside the existing "Connect ground station" action.
- **Agent client `getSetupStatus()`** at `src/lib/agent/client.ts`
  with a `SetupStatusSchema` zod schema validating the full
  response tree (`SetupStep`, `SetupAccessUrl`, `MavlinkAccess`,
  `VideoAccess`, `RemoteAccessStatus`, `NetworkStatus`).
- **Cloud-relay schema** carries absolute URLs from the agent:
  `setupUrl`, `apiUrl`, `missionControlUrl`, `videoWhepUrl`,
  `mavlinkWsUrl`, and `remoteAccess`. Both `convex/schema.ts` and
  `convex/cmdDroneStatus.ts` accept the new fields, and
  `convex/http.ts` ingests them. The Command fleet store, the
  CloudStatusBridge mapper, and the agent video-session hook
  prefer the absolute URLs over rebuilding from `lastIp + port`.
- **`feat(command)`**: fleet overview tile with live video and
  telemetry. `CommandFleetOverview.tsx` now renders an inline
  WHEP video preview alongside the per-drone telemetry chips,
  driven by the new absolute-URL plumbing on the agent side.
- **`feat(simulation)`**: camera-trigger toggle. Sim drones now
  publish trigger events the planner consumes, with sync-perf
  improvements on the playback path.
- **`feat(planner)`**: conditional UI render based on the active
  plan. Idle / loaded / dirty states diverge cleanly so the
  planner does not animate empty panels on cold start.
- **`feat(cli)`**: production-deployment wizard and service-
  management subcommands on the `altnautica-command` CLI. Prompts
  walk through TLS, MQTT, video-relay, and Convex bindings; the
  service subcommand wraps `systemctl` for the standard units.
  Public-docs entry at `docs/cli-reference.md` and self-hosting
  guide updated.
- **`AGENTS.md`** with agentic-coding instructions for AI contributors.

### Changed

- **Hardware Overview poll on `/api/v1/setup/status`** gained a
  visibility guard so it pauses while the tab is hidden, matching
  the ground-station poll on the same page.
- **CommandFleetOverview** prefers absolute `videoWhepUrl` and
  `mavlinkWsUrl` advertised by the agent before falling back to
  the previous `lastIp + port` reconstruction.

### Fixed

- **`fix(cloud-relay)`**: agent-facing HTTP routes are now backed
  by Convex internal mutations only. External callers can no
  longer reach the heartbeat write path directly.
- **`fix(CloudStatusBridge)`**: the bridge no longer enqueues
  cloud commands when the user is unauthenticated; previously a
  silent failure path could fire commands during sign-out.
- **`fix(use-agent-video-session)`**: null-check before assigning
  `srcObject` to the video element. Closes a TypeError on disconnect.
- **`fix`**: prevent connection attempt when `whepUrl` is missing.
  The video pipeline used to fire WebRTC negotiation against
  `undefined` after a partial cloud-status snapshot.
- **`fix(ui)`**: escape quotes in UI text and clean up test mocks
  flagged by the linter.
- **`fix`**: input validation, response limits, and safety overrides
  on the agent-facing surface. Bounds requests that previously
  could wedge the relay on malformed payloads.

### Notes

- Pairs with ARCOS Drone Agent v0.10.0 (universal setup contract).
- Mission Control still consumes `lastIp + port` as a fallback so
  older agents continue to work without re-pairing.
- Convex schema is in sync with the website's `convex/schema.ts`
  per the dual-Convex convention.
