# MQTT relay deployment

Reference deployment for the ARCOS cloud relay stack: a Mosquitto MQTT broker
plus a Node bridge that forwards agent heartbeats to Convex. Designed to run
behind a Cloudflare Tunnel on a small VM or LXC container.

```
agent (drone)  ─MQTT(S)─►  mosquitto  ─►  mqtt-bridge  ─►  Convex
                              ▲
                              │
GCS browser  ─MQTT/WSS─────────┘  (also subscribes to arcos/<device>/*)
```

This README covers the production deployment with per-device auth. For a
quick anonymous bench broker (CI fixtures), see the comments at the bottom of
`mosquitto.conf`.

## Auth model

Three principal types connect to the broker:

| Principal | Username | Password source | Permissions |
|---|---|---|---|
| Drone agent | `<device_id>` (current firmware) or `arcos-<device_id>` (legacy firmware; transitional) | `cmd_drones.apiKey` from Convex; same value the agent uses for HTTP `X-ARCOS-Key` | `readwrite arcos/<device_id>/#` |
| Bridge service account | `arcos` | `MQTT_PASSWORD` env var on the broker host | `read arcos/#` |
| GCS browser session | `gcs-viewer` | `MQTT_VIEWER_PASSWORD` published via Convex `clientConfig.getClientConfig` query | `read arcos/+/#` |

The ACL is generated alongside the passwd file from the device list in
Convex; both files are atomic-swapped into place on every regen.

`regenerate-passwd.sh` writes BOTH username conventions (legacy prefixed +
canonical bare) for each device so a fleet midway through a firmware
upgrade keeps working. Set `DROP_LEGACY_USERNAMES=1` in the script env
once every agent has rolled over to the canonical username.

## Production deployment

The reference layout (matches Altnautica's own broker at
`mqtt.altnautica.com`):

```
/opt/relay/
├── docker-compose.yml
├── .env                        # MQTT_PASSWORD for the bridge user
└── mosquitto/
    ├── mosquitto.conf          # from this directory
    ├── acl.conf                # from this directory
    └── passwd                  # generated; one line per paired device + bridge
```

The `passwd` file is the only piece that contains secrets. **Never commit
it** — see `.gitignore` in this directory.

### One-time setup

1. Pick a strong password for the bridge service account. Add it to your
   broker host's `/opt/relay/.env` as `MQTT_PASSWORD=<value>` (the bridge
   container already reads this via `MQTT_USERNAME=arcos` /
   `MQTT_PASSWORD=${MQTT_PASSWORD}`).
2. Pick a strong relay secret (`openssl rand -hex 32`). Set it as
   `MQTT_AUTH_RELAY_SECRET` BOTH on the Convex deployment AND in
   `/opt/relay/.env` on the broker host. This gates the
   `/admin/mqtt-auth-entries` httpAction that the regen script reads.
3. Pick a strong viewer password (`openssl rand -base64 24`). Set it as
   `MQTT_VIEWER_PASSWORD` on the Convex deployment AND in `/opt/relay/.env`
   on the broker host. The Convex `clientConfig.getClientConfig` query
   publishes it to every browser session; the broker's ACL gives this
   user read-only access on `arcos/+/#`.
4. Deploy the Convex functions (`npx convex deploy`) so the
   `clientConfig`, `cmdPairing.listMqttAuthEntries`, and
   `/admin/mqtt-auth-entries` paths are live.
5. Make sure Mission Control's MqttBridge has been rebuilt with the
   viewer-auth path landed (this monorepo's `src/components/command/MqttBridge.tsx`
   + `CommandFleetMqttBridge.tsx` consume `clientConfig.mqttViewerPassword`).
   Coolify auto-rebuilds on push to `main`.
6. Copy `mosquitto.conf`, `acl.conf` (will be auto-generated; see below),
   `regenerate-passwd.sh`, `activate-auth.sh`, and `deactivate-auth.sh`
   from this directory to the broker host's `/opt/relay/`.
7. Update `docker-compose.yml` on the broker host to mount `acl.conf`
   alongside the existing `mosquitto.conf` + `passwd` mounts. The full
   volumes block looks like:
   ```yaml
   services:
     mosquitto:
       volumes:
         - ./mosquitto/mosquitto.conf:/mosquitto/config/mosquitto.conf:ro
         - ./mosquitto/acl.conf:/mosquitto/config/acl.conf:ro
         - ./mosquitto/passwd:/mosquitto/config/passwd:ro
         - mosquitto-data:/mosquitto/data
   ```
8. Generate the initial `passwd` + `acl.conf` (the script writes both):
   ```bash
   cd /opt/relay
   set -a; source .env; set +a
   ./regenerate-passwd.sh
   ```
9. Flip auth on:
   ```bash
   ./activate-auth.sh
   ```
   To roll back: `./deactivate-auth.sh`. Both scripts are idempotent and
   take backups before changing `mosquitto.conf`.
10. Watch the broker logs for any `not authorised` lines and confirm the
    GCS reconnects with the viewer credential. If the GCS isn't picking
    up the new credential, do a hard refresh — the Convex query result is
    cached client-side until the page reloads.

### Generating passwd

#### Altnautica production (this monorepo)

Use the helper script. It hits a Convex httpAction (gated by
`MQTT_AUTH_RELAY_SECRET`) to pull paired devices, runs `mosquitto_passwd`
inside the broker container, atomic-renames the new passwd into place,
and SIGHUPs the broker.

One-time setup (operator):

1. Pick a strong relay secret (`openssl rand -hex 32`). Add it to:
   - Convex environment as `MQTT_AUTH_RELAY_SECRET` (via the self-hosted
     dashboard or `npx convex env set MQTT_AUTH_RELAY_SECRET …` from a
     dev machine).
   - The broker host's `/opt/relay/.env` as `MQTT_AUTH_RELAY_SECRET=…`.
2. Pick a strong bridge password and store it in `/opt/relay/.env` as
   `MQTT_PASSWORD=…` (the bridge already reads this env var).
3. Deploy the Convex changes (`npx convex deploy` from a dev machine)
   so the `/admin/mqtt-auth-entries` httpAction is live.
4. Copy `scripts/regenerate-passwd.sh` to `/opt/relay/regenerate-passwd.sh`,
   `chmod +x`, run once to seed `/opt/relay/mosquitto/passwd`.

```bash
# On the broker host (alt-services):
cd /opt/relay
set -a; source .env; set +a
./regenerate-passwd.sh
```

5. Optional: install a systemd timer (or cron) that runs the script every
   60 seconds so newly-paired devices authenticate without operator
   intervention. Example unit at the bottom of this README.

#### OSS self-hosters

Use `mosquitto_passwd` directly. For each paired device, you'll need its
`device_id` (the username) and its `api_key` (the password). Both are stored
in your Convex deployment on the `cmd_drones` table after pairing.

```bash
# First entry creates the file:
mosquitto_passwd -c /opt/relay/mosquitto/passwd <device_id>
# Subsequent entries append:
mosquitto_passwd /opt/relay/mosquitto/passwd <another_device_id>
# Add the bridge service account last:
mosquitto_passwd /opt/relay/mosquitto/passwd arcos
# Reload the broker:
docker exec relay-mosquitto-1 kill -HUP 1
```

`mosquitto_passwd` will prompt for each password interactively. If you'd
rather scriptify it, pass `-b` and feed plaintext passwords from a secrets
manager — never from a shell history file.

### Adding a device

After a new agent finishes pairing through Mission Control, it will appear
in the `cmd_drones` Convex table with a fresh `apiKey`. The broker won't let
the agent connect until that `(device_id, api_key)` lands in `passwd`. Run
the regen script (Altnautica) or `mosquitto_passwd` (OSS) and SIGHUP the
broker.

For Altnautica production, the regen script is also wired to a 60-second
systemd timer so new devices authenticate within 1 minute of pairing without
operator intervention.

### Revoking a device

1. Delete the device row from Convex (`cmd_drones`).
2. Re-run the regen script (Altnautica) OR manually remove the line from
   `passwd` and SIGHUP the broker (OSS).

Existing connections from the revoked device persist until the next reconnect.
For immediate disconnect, restart the broker container.

## Sanity checks

```bash
# Inside the broker container:
docker exec -it relay-mosquitto-1 sh

# 1. Device can publish to its own subtree.
mosquitto_pub -h localhost -p 1883 \
  -u <device_id> -P <api_key> \
  -t "arcos/<device_id>/test" -m "hello"
# Should succeed.

# 2. Device CANNOT publish to another device's subtree.
mosquitto_pub -h localhost -p 1883 \
  -u <device_id> -P <api_key> \
  -t "arcos/<other_device>/test" -m "should fail"
# Should be silently dropped by the ACL (return code 0 but no message
# delivered). Confirm by watching the broker logs for "Denied".

# 3. GCS viewer can subscribe to any device's status topic.
mosquitto_sub -h localhost -p 1883 \
  -u gcs-viewer -P <MQTT_VIEWER_PASSWORD> \
  -t "arcos/+/status" -C 1 -W 5
# Should print one status message OR time out cleanly (return 27).

# 4. GCS viewer CANNOT publish.
mosquitto_pub -h localhost -p 1883 \
  -u gcs-viewer -P <MQTT_VIEWER_PASSWORD> \
  -t "arcos/<device_id>/command" -m "should fail"
# Should be denied by the ACL.
```

## Limitations

- The agent's MQTT password equals its Convex `apiKey`. If you rotate the
  apiKey on a device row in Convex (re-pairing), you MUST regenerate `passwd`
  before the agent reconnects.
- New devices have a ≤ 60s authentication window after pairing while waiting
  for the regen timer.
- The bridge container's `MQTT_PASSWORD` env var lives in `/opt/relay/.env`
  on the broker host. Protect that file with mode `600` and don't ship it
  off-host.

## Systemd timer for automatic regen

Copy these unit files to `/etc/systemd/system/` on the broker host:

`mqtt-passwd-regen.service`:
```ini

WantedBy=timers.target
```

Activate with:
```bash
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable --now mqtt-passwd-regen.timer
systemctl status mqtt-passwd-regen.timer
```
